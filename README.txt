Author: Ytzhak Ariel Armoni 

I simulated the role of the disk management system in the operating system Linux, that is, 
to map all parts of the file that are stored on the disk. The parts of the file are saved 
in small units which are called 'blocks' and are organized into one logical unit, that is the file. 
 
The parts of the file are not directly and continuously on the disk but are scattered over the 
surface of the disk. 

I have simulated this action programming with the C++ language in the VMware using the OS Linux, 
executing the cpp file and using the command line to use the program. 

The commands are the next: PRESS THE NEXT BUTTONS ON YOUR KEYBOARD WHEN THE PROGGRAM ITS RUNNING:

0: WHEN YOU PUSH THE NUMBER 0 DELETE ALLL THE DISK
1: WHEN YOU PUSH THE NUMBER 1 YOU PRINT ALL THE FILES ACCORDING THE FILES, EVERY ONE.
2: WHEN YOU PUSH THE NUMBER 2 START THE DISK AND THEN PUT IN THE BLOCK SIZE THAT YOU WANT
3: WHEN YOU PUSH THE NUMBER 3 CREATE A NEW FILE 
4: WHEN YOU PUSH THE NUMBER 4 THE WILL OPEN A FILE THAT YOU CLOSED BEFORE
5: WHEN YOU PUSH THE NUMBER 5 THE WILL CLOSE A FILE ACCORDING THE FILE NAME THAT YOU GIVED 
6: WHEN YOU PUSH THE NUMBER 6 THE WILL WRITE DATA TO THE DISK
7: WHEN YOU PUSH THE NUMBER 7 THE WILL READ DATA FROM THE DISK ACOORDING THE SIZE YOU GIVED
8: WHEN YOU PUSH THE NUMBER 8 THE WILL CLOSE A FILE DEFINITIVELY

Instructions:
Every time that we run the program, we will put in every time data according the instructions 
that every step its idicated in the program.

How to compile the á¹•rogram: 

when you access to the main program push the button green hammer, and then will be compiled.

In the terminal:

g++ Disk.cpp -o Disk

Terminal will be reused by tasks, press any key to close it.

>>means that the program was compiled successfully!.

How to run the program:
WITH: ./Disk (at the terminal)

Press the green play button and then will appears an screen where the output will appear there.

The programm is distributed in JUST ONE FILE. 

Output expected:(The input must to do it in the terminal)the number pointed out with >> are the output the other numberes are the input.

Starting Program...
Disk started, please format the Disk.
